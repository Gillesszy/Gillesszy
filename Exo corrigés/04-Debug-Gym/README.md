## Background & Objectives

Only one lesson to learn from this exercise : **READ THE ERROR** ! This will tell you

- the kind of error you have
- the line where it occurs in your program

## Specs

Just run

```bash
rake
```

the code in "bugged_concatenate.rb" has got some error. Try to fix it by reading the error on the terminal. The error message should tell you what seems to be the problem.
